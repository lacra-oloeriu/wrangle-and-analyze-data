Introduction

Maybe you heard about one of the most famous meme of 2016 "they're good dogs Brent"and of corse the twitter acount WeRateDogs?
It was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media coverage both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when it was suspended by Twitter.


Here I can do analize a bit and I can show you a some Analysis of WeRateDogs tweets data than I colect on the internet.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter acount that rates people's dogs whit fun things comments about the dog.These ratings almost have a denominator of 10.The numerators are always greater than 10( 11/10, 12/10, 14/10, etc).In theory the rates should be 1 to 10 .But , WeRateDogs disagree , they admit almost all the dogs that they deserve a 10 and sometimes more than that.


The site has over 6 millions followers and has received international media coverege.One of those coverage were about the quote "they're good dogs Brent", that was an exchenge in which WeRateDogs shut down a person having an issue whit its rating system in humoroud ways.


Most common dog type


The site has over 6000+ tweets .I was able to analyzed around 1500+ tweets .The most rated dog was golden retrever whit more than 140 ratings.The secound it was Labrador retriever and the therd Pembroke.The las rated dog eas Cocker spaniel and french bulldog.



Lowes average rating among dog types


Almost all dogs deserve ratings about 10.This is a notable exception that i see in the site.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that does exactly what it says. It rates dogs. And it's hilarious.

All you have to do is send them a picture of your dog via direct message (or any dog come to think of it) and they'll give it a score from one to ten. The only problem is, some people seem to be sending them pictures of things that CLEARLY aren't dogs!
